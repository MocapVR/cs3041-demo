# Design for Another World â€” CS3041-D18
#### Mikel Matticoli, Brandon Coll
## Design Goal: Design interactivity of an otherwise boring virtual space to make it interesting/fun


There are two demos below. The first is a Google Cardboard demo that allows you to move around using a bluetooth controller or keyboard.

The second demonstrates interaction with an identical virtual space, adding full-body motion tracking and basic physics

--Pending--

The physics are not complicated- the hands and feet of our character have spherical colliders to allow them to push/kick other objects, 
but this simple direct interaction turns an otherwise boring virtual space into an effective playground.
